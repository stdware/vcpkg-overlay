cpp-pinyin provides CMake targets:

find_package(cpp-pinyin CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE cpp-pinyin::cpp-pinyin)

To use the library, you need to copy the dictionary files to the binary directory.

add_custom_command(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory
    ${_VCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR}/${VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET}/share/cpp-pinyin/dict
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:${PROJECT_NAME}>/dict
)

To generate your own dictionary files, you can use the pinyin-makedict tool provided by cpp-pinyin.
